INTERN ID : CT2MTDM665

DOMAIN : Machine Learning

DURATION : 8 WEEKS

MENTOR : NEELA SANTOSH
# DESCRIPTION
This project implements a Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering based on Matrix Factorization techniques. Specifically, it uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) from the Surprise library to predict missing user-item interactions and recommend top items to users.

The goal is to build a system that provides personalized suggestions to users (e.g., movies, products) based on historical user preferences. This project is part of the internship task under CodTech and includes steps like data preparation, model training, evaluation, and generating recommendation results.

# Technologies Used
Python
Surprise â€“ Scikit-Surprise library for collaborative filtering
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib (optional for visuals)

# Techniques Used
Collaborative Filtering (user-based or item-based)
Matrix Factorization using SVD
Evaluation using metrics: RMSE, MAE
Generating Top-N recommendations per user
